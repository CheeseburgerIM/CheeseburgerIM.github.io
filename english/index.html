<p><strong>Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 字数:150~300</strong></p>
<p>​	Recently, heated debates on a prevailing topic that whether playing computer games is negative or positive, particularly for children, are right on their way. From my own perspective, it seems like a coin with two sides.</p>
<p>​	Initially, speaking of the detrimental effect that playing computer games have on children, quite a few people support that computer games would do nothing beneficial to children but to rot their brains, render them shortsighted and deprive them of precious time. Actually, it is understandable that they are concerned that these games are liable to cause slipping grades of their children. Moreover, these games serve no purpose beyond temptation so that children would devote their energy and money to the virtual world and even be addicted, which their parents regard as a serious problem.</p>
<p>​	Nevertheless, there are some people standing by the opinion that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. For example, children are capable of relieving stress in the school by playing computer games with their friends and classmates, which can also facilitate the relationships between them. In addition, children and even adults are overly fond of the feeling that they can do a large quantity of things in the games that seem pretty impossible in the real world.</p>
<p>​	Ultimately, playing computer games is indeed like a rose with its thorns, but I am in favor of the latter viewpoint. On condition that children can distinguish between hobbies and addictions, I perceive it is advisable to play computer games.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>Puppy Love</font></b></center>
<p>For some people, there’s no better companion than man’s best friend –a dog.</p>
<p>This four-legged canine can bring comfort and joy and provide much-needed exercise for you when it needs walkies!</p>
<p>This probably explains why dog ownership increased last year because people spent more time at home during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown.</p>
<p>It was demand for puppies in particular that saw the biggest increase. Who couldn’t resist their playful personalities, adorable eyes, and super-soft coats?</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1613813342_93639.jpeg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>However, as demand for a new puppy increased, so did the price tag. Popular breeds, such as Cockapoos and Cocker Spaniels, saw even sharper price increases, and puppies have been selling for £3,000or more.</p>
<p>Animal welfare charities fear that high prices could encourage puppy farming, smuggling or dog theft.</p>
<p>But despite some new owners purchasing a dog legally, maybe from a rescue centre or registered breeder, they’ve proved to be ill-prepared for life with a new pet, and the pet itself has found it hard tocome to terms with life in a new home.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, there are concerns about the welfare of these much-loved pets.</p>
<p>Ian Atkin, manager of the Oxfordshire Animal Sanctuary in the UK, told the BBC: “At the moment, the dogs are having a great time, but separation anxiety could still surface when people go back to work.”</p>
<p>And Claire Calder from the UK’s Dogs Trust rescue charity says “the economic situation also means that some people may find they can’t afford to look after a dog.” The message is not to buy a puppy in haste and to pick one that fits into your lifestyle.</p>

<p>A sweet little girl was holding two apples in both hands.</p>
<p>Her mum came in, and with a smile, softly asked her daughter: “Sweetie, could you give your mum one of those apples?”</p>
<p>The girl looked up at her mum for a few seconds, then suddenly took a quick bite of one apple, and then a quick bite of the other.</p>
<p>The mum felt the smile on her face freeze.</p>
<p>She tried hard not to reveal her disappointment.</p>
<p>Then the little girl handed one of her bitten-into apples to her mum, and said: “Here you are, Mummy. This one is much sweeter.”</p>

<p>A 24-year-old boy seeing out from the train’s window shouted,</p>

<p>Dad smiled and a young couple, sitting nearby, looked at the 24-year-old’s childish behavior with pity. Suddenly he again exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Dad, look the clouds are running with us!”</p>
<p>The couple couldn’t resist and said to the old man,</p>
<p>“Why don’t you take your son to a good doctor?”</p>
<p>The old man smiled and said, “I did and we are just coming from the hospital. My son was blind frombirth. He just got his eyes today.”</p>

<center><b><font size=6>Why Do We Laugh?</font></b></center>
<p>People from all cultures laugh, although we may laugh at different things.</p>
<p>Humans start laughing as early as 3 months into life, even before we can speak.</p>
<p>So, the ubiquitous nature of laughter suggests that it must serve a purpose, but what?</p>
<p>Laughter serves a social function. It is a way for us to signal to another person that we wish to connectwith them.</p>
<p>We’re more likely to laugh in a group. Young children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 were found to be eight times more likely to laugh at a cartoon when they watched it with another child.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking, this signal of connection likely played an important role in survival. Upon meeting a stranger, we want to know: What are your intentions with me? And who else are you aligned with?</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1595229221_3352.jpeg" alt="2021/2/12" /></p>
<p>Another theory is that laughter may be a replacement for the act of grooming each other. Grooming another is a behavior seen in primates and requires trust and investment of time.</p>
<p>As our communities got larger, we couldn’t all go around grooming each other to establish bonds.</p>
<p>But laughter, like the commitment offered through grooming, is hard to fake; unlike grooming, it can be done in a larger group. When we genuinely laugh, we signal that we are comfortable and feel like we belong.</p>
<p>There are also a multitude of physical health benefits to laughter.</p>
<p>Laughter can increase your oxygen intake, which can in turn stimulate your heart, lungs, and muscles.</p>
<p>The act of increasing and then decreasing our heart rate through laughter is also ultimately calming and tension-relieving.</p>
<p>So laughter signals cooperation, a key aspect of human survival, and promotes a healthier body to boot.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>What Makes Us Afraid？</font></b></center>
<p>What are the things that scare you: snakes, spiders or creepy crawlies?</p>
<p>Or maybe you have a fear of heights or visiting the dentist.</p>
<p>Although some of us just get scared or a bit nervous about these things, for others it can cause an irrational reaction that can’t be controlled –something we call a phobia.</p>
<p>It occurs when someone develops an exaggerated or unrealistic sense of danger about a situation or object.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1611677855_60094.jpeg" alt="2021/2/1" /></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s good to be aware of the possible dangers from things. Our brain alerts us to the risks that might lie ahead, but then we often rationalise the risks and overcome them.</p>
<p>But phobias are stronger than just fears.</p>
<p>Clinical psychologist Warren Mansell says: “An area called the amygdala in the brain is recognising a threat and preparing your body for fight or flight.” With a phobia, your breathing gets quicker, your pulse speeds up, you sweat, and your brain is unable to control these reactions.</p>
<p>But where does a phobia come from?</p>
<p>Lauren Rosenberg, a fear and phobia expert, says: “Phobias usually are a copy behaviour from a higherauthority, like a parent or teacher, or something you have learnt from your own experience.” Or a trauma from a past event that comes back to haunt you.</p>
<p>There are many different complex phobias some people suffer from, such as agoraphobia –triggered by being away from home, social anxiety disorder –feeling anxious in social situations, and iatrophobia –fear of doctors.</p>
<p>But how can they be overcome?</p>
<p>Cognitive behavioural therapy is one option, where you gradually get used to whatever it is you fear.</p>
<p>Lauren Rosenburg says she likes to work with people to clear their subconscious memory and help them breathe. But if you do have a phobia, continually trying to avoid what you’re afraid of is likely to make the situation worse, so it’s a good idea to find help to overcome it.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>Escapism，Procrastination，and the Dark Playground</font></b></center>
<p>We often try to escape realities that seem overwhelming or that we don’t like.</p>
<p>In a study from StudyMode, feeling overwhelmed and not liking the work are the top 2 reasons college students procrastinate.</p>
<p>Because students do not like the work they are assigned to do, or don’t know where to start, instead they divert their attention and escape into things they would rather be doing or are easier to understand.</p>
<p>In a post from two weeks ago, The Internet: Procrastination Station, it was noted that TV and movies, along with social media are the top two avenues used for procrastination among college students.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1603161065_49142.jpeg" alt="2021/1/31" /></p>
<p>However, indulging fantasy or our sense of instant gratification is a way to escape reality. And this takes us to a dark place; a place where we play and partake in unearned leisure activities. This place is named the dark playground.</p>
<p>In the dark playground, we choose fun over work and responsibility and as a result that “fun” is clouded by guilt.</p>
<p>The dark playground is important in appropriately giving escapism a home in relation to procrastination.</p>
<p>Say, for example, if you were to spend 3 hours watching TV series when you should be writing an essay, that’s where escapism becomes procrastination and where guilt is wrapped in fun in the dark playground.</p>
<p>As long as you are trying to avoid something, a part of you is vibrating at a level of shame or guilt.</p>
<p>To avoid entering the dark playground, you need to confront what you are trying to escape from. Face it and get it done. This is the key to overcome the tricky beast, procrastination.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>Comparison Is the Thief of Joy</font></b></center>
<p>In our life, we all try to get better every day. We all set dreams in our life.</p>
<p>To win the life race, we work hard and with the time we finally accomplish it. We become happy and celebrate it. It is all right and it should be in that way.</p>
<p>But our happiness last for very short time when we start comparing the things with others.</p>
<p>We all want to get ahead among friends, colleagues, and even among family. If today you are happy just because you have more than others then be ready to lose your happiness because it will start vanishing when you see someone else having more than you.</p>
<p>You spent months or may be even years to get where you are. But it will only take a few days to end your feeling of joy if it is based on what others have.</p>
<p>Actually you can never compare yourself with others. You may know yourself completely.</p>
<p>You may be aware of what you have and how you got that. But you can never know what circumstances someone else has and how he got that. You can compare one factor but you never even know other factors. What you see is not always the whole thing.</p>
<p>Respect every one for what he is and love yourself for whatever you are.</p>
<p>If you still want to compare, compare with yourself. Think what you have done better today than you did yesterday. Keep yourself growing and celebrate your victories without comparing them to anyone else.</p>
<p>It is good to get inspired from someone you think is better than you. But do not get caught by comparison.</p>
<p>Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>How to Break Bad Habbits</font></b></center>
<p>Habits are ways of dealing with issues in your environment. You often do not think about them.</p>
<p>James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits, describes a four-step process by which habits are made. These steps are cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1610641529_88583.jpeg" alt="BAD HABBITS" /></p>
<p>A cue is a signal. It tells your brain to do something: to begin a behavior. A craving is a desire for something. The response, or reaction, is the habit that you perform. The response gives you a reward.</p>
<p>Imagine you are studying English. Perhaps you are learning new words or expressions. But then you feel the need to check your phone. You return to your studies, only to look again at your phone a short time later.</p>
<p>This process, when repeated many times, could reduce your ability to learn new material. It is what you might call a bad habit –a custom or repeated action that has a negative effect on you or your goals.</p>
<p>James Clear notes that to break bad habits, you need to think about each step in the habit-making process.</p>
<p>In the cell phone example, the cue is seeing the cell phone. The craving is the desire or urge to check your phone. The response is checking your phone. The reward might be seeing something interesting on social media, for example.</p>
<p>To break a habit, he writes, you should think about making the bad habit invisible, unattractive, difficult and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>To make your phone invisible, you could hide it away.</p>
<p>To make it unattractive, you could think about why it is a good idea to stop checking the phone.</p>
<p>To make phone use difficult, you can increase the space between you and your phone.</p>
<p>To make your phone unsatisfying, you could make a habit contract.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that people can change their habits.</p>
<p>Habit changes take time. But with patience, planning, and repetition, you can do it.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>The Seasons of Life</font></b></center>
<p>There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly.</p>
<p>So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away.</p>
<p>The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in the summer, and the youngest son in the fall.</p>
<p>When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen.</p>
<p>The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted.</p>
<p>The second son said no — it was covered with green buds and full of promise.</p>
<p>The third son disagreed. He said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful; it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen.</p>
<p>The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfilment.</p>
<p><img src="https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ff6970a3ffa7d37b3f9eed7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree’s life.</p>
<p>He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are — and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life — can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.</p>
<p>If you give up when it’s winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer and fulfilment of your fall.</p>
<p>Don’t judge a life by one difficult season. Don’t let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.</p>

<center><b><font size=6>Why Is It So Hard to Put Down Our Phones?</font></b></center>
<p>How many times have you picked up your phone and looked at something in the last hour?</p>
<p>The average Brit checks their screen every 12 minutes, according to the latest research.</p>
<p>You might find yourself checking your phone at the slightest feeling of boredom, purely out of habit. App developers are not relying on you to come to them whenever you have a bit of downtime, they want to grab your attention.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1594969617_73955.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>For example, push notifications make sure you keep picking up your phone to see what the announcement is and to see what you may have missed.</p>
<p>There may be something new and enticing for us to engage with, or we may have received lots of likes for a social media post.</p>
<p>When we do get a like, a follower, comment or share of our post, it excites the brain and produces a chemical which you may have heard of called dopamine.</p>
<p>This is a chemical that provides a “feel-good” response to these rewards. Because it feels good, we are tempted to repeat the activity that created the good feeling.</p>
<p>This loop is one of the biggest reasons why we are checking our phones every 12 minutes. So, how can we break the loop so that real life does not pass us by?</p>
<p>The first is to turn off all notifications on your phone so that you are not distracted or tempted by the alluring messages.</p>
<p>Next is to put your phone out of sight. This is particularly helpful if you are revising or have a project to get done.</p>
<p>Finally, look for and create opportunities for gaining a dopamine hit in other ways, for example through exercise or music.</p>

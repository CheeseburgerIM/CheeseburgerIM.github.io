<p>12/10</p>
<p><strong>Some people say that playing computer games is bad for children in every aspect. Others say that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. Discuss both views and give your opinion. 字数:150~300</strong></p>
<p>​	Recently, heated debates on a prevailing topic that whether playing computer games is negative or positive, particularly for children, are right on their way. From my own perspective, it seems like a coin with two sides.</p>
<p>​	Initially, speaking of the detrimental effect that playing computer games have on children, quite a few people support that computer games would do nothing beneficial to children but to rot their brains, render them shortsighted and deprive them of precious time. Actually, it is understandable that they are concerned that these games are liable to cause slipping grades of their children. Moreover, these games serve no purpose beyond temptation so that children would devote their energy and money to the virtual world and even be addicted, which their parents regard as a serious problem.</p>
<p>​	Nevertheless, there are some people standing by the opinion that playing computer games can have positive effects on the way children develop. For example, children are capable of relieving stress in the school by playing computer games with their friends and classmates, which can also facilitate the relationships between them. In addition, children and even adults are overly fond of the feeling that they can do a large quantity of things in the games that seem pretty impossible in the real world.</p>
<p>​	Ultimately, playing computer games is indeed like a rose with its thorns, but I am in favor of the latter viewpoint. On condition that children can distinguish between hobbies and addictions, I perceive it is advisable to play computer games.</p>

<p><strong>How to Break Bad Habbits</strong></p>
<p>Habits are ways of dealing with issues in your environment. You often do not think about them.</p>
<p>James Clear, in his book Atomic Habits, describes a four-step process by which habits are made. These steps are cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1610641529_88583.jpeg" alt="BAD HABBITS" /></p>
<p>A cue is a signal. It tells your brain to do something: to begin a behavior. A craving is a desire for something. The response, or reaction, is the habit that you perform. The response gives you a reward.</p>
<p>Imagine you are studying English. Perhaps you are learning new words or expressions. But then you feel the need to check your phone. You return to your studies, only to look again at your phone a short time later.</p>
<p>This process, when repeated many times, could reduce your ability to learn new material. It is what you might call a bad habit –a custom or repeated action that has a negative effect on you or your goals.</p>
<p>James Clear notes that to break bad habits, you need to think about each step in the habit-making process.</p>
<p>In the cell phone example, the cue is seeing the cell phone. The craving is the desire or urge to check your phone. The response is checking your phone. The reward might be seeing something interesting on social media, for example.</p>
<p>To break a habit, he writes, you should think about making the bad habit invisible, unattractive, difficult and unsatisfying.</p>
<p>To make your phone invisible, you could hide it away.</p>
<p>To make it unattractive, you could think about why it is a good idea to stop checking the phone.</p>
<p>To make phone use difficult, you can increase the space between you and your phone.</p>
<p>To make your phone unsatisfying, you could make a habit contract.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember is that people can change their habits.</p>
<p>Habit changes take time. But with patience, planning, and repetition, you can do it.</p>

<p>There was a man who had four sons. He wanted his sons to learn to not judge things too quickly.</p>
<p>So he sent them each on a quest, in turn, to go and look at a pear tree that was a great distance away.</p>
<p>The first son went in the winter, the second in the spring, the third in the summer, and the youngest son in the fall.</p>
<p>When they had all gone and come back, he called them together to describe what they had seen.</p>
<p>The first son said that the tree was ugly, bent, and twisted.</p>
<p>The second son said no — it was covered with green buds and full of promise.</p>
<p>The third son disagreed. He said it was laden with blossoms that smelled so sweet and looked so beautiful; it was the most graceful thing he had ever seen.</p>
<p>The last son disagreed with all of them; he said it was ripe and drooping with fruit, full of life and fulfilment.</p>
<p><img src="https://pic.downk.cc/item/5ff6970a3ffa7d37b3f9eed7.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The man then explained to his sons that they were all right, because they had each seen but one season in the tree’s life.</p>
<p>He told them that you cannot judge a tree, or a person, by only one season, and that the essence of who they are — and the pleasure, joy, and love that come from that life — can only be measured at the end, when all the seasons are up.</p>
<p>If you give up when it’s winter, you will miss the promise of your spring, the beauty of your summer and fulfilment of your fall.</p>
<p>Don’t judge a life by one difficult season. Don’t let the pain of one season destroy the joy of all the rest.</p>

<p>Why Is It So Hard to Put Down Our Phones?</p>
<p>How many times have you picked up your phone and looked at something in the last hour?</p>
<p>The average Brit checks their screen every 12 minutes, according to the latest research.</p>
<p>You might find yourself checking your phone at the slightest feeling of boredom, purely out of habit. App developers are not relying on you to come to them whenever you have a bit of downtime, they want to grab your attention.</p>
<p><img src="https://ali.bczcdn.com/reading_image/rimg_999999999_1594969617_73955.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<p>For example, push notifications make sure you keep picking up your phone to see what the announcement is and to see what you may have missed.</p>
<p>There may be something new and enticing for us to engage with, or we may have received lots of likes for a social media post.</p>
<p>When we do get a like, a follower, comment or share of our post, it excites the brain and produces a chemical which you may have heard of called dopamine.</p>
<p>This is a chemical that provides a “feel-good” response to these rewards. Because it feels good, we are tempted to repeat the activity that created the good feeling.</p>
<p>This loop is one of the biggest reasons why we are checking our phones every 12 minutes. So, how can we break the loop so that real life does not pass us by?</p>
<p>The first is to turn off all notifications on your phone so that you are not distracted or tempted by the alluring messages.</p>
<p>Next is to put your phone out of sight. This is particularly helpful if you are revising or have a project to get done.</p>
<p>Finally, look for and create opportunities for gaining a dopamine hit in other ways, for example through exercise or music.</p>
